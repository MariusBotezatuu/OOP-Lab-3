## Earth Simulation Game
In this earth simulation game you can basically create your own world by choosing the world size/type and adding things to it, such as hills, plants, 
animals, calamities, people, etc. Every class is a subclass of the abstract class "Entity". This means that every class contains an id, and 2 methods: one 
for setting the string type and one for getting the string type. There are 2 more abstract classes that inherit the abstract class "Entity": "Organisms" 
and "DetrimentalThings". These are used by several other classes to inherit their fields, methods + add their own fields and methods. Further information 
can be seen in the diagram below
